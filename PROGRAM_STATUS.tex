\section*{Program Status Declaration}

\textbf{Status: Conditional Completion}

All reductions, formalizations, and empirical searches in the locality--cycle
overlap program are complete.

A single dependency remains, isolated and explicit:

\begin{quote}
\emph{Overlap Rigidity Axiom:} bounded-degree graphs with sufficiently rich local
cycle overlap cannot remain FO$^k$-homogeneous at all bounded radii.
\end{quote}

No WL1/WL2/WL3-homogeneous bounded-degree families with high local overlap were
found despite exhaustive constructive and stress-testing efforts.

All downstream theorems are correct conditional on this axiom.
No additional assumptions are present.

\bigskip
\noindent
This declaration freezes the program in its final conditional state.

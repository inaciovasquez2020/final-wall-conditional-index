Final Wall Conditional Index

Index of all conditional dependencies in the Final Wall program.

This repository provides a curated and authoritative index of all repositories, artifacts, and formal materials supporting the Conditional Final Wall result. It is intended for referees, editors, researchers, and independent verifiers.

Overview

The Final Wall program studies locality, cycle overlap, and conditional rigidity in finite structures, isolating the one remaining conditional dependency required to complete the entire research pipeline.

This repository functions as an index linking all major codebases and formal artifacts associated with the program.

Repository Contents

Conditional_Final_Wall_Index.tex
Main index listing all artifacts and repositories.

PROGRAM_STATUS.tex
Program status declaration and final statement of conditional completion.

Purpose

This index:

Registers all repositories, manuscripts, and supporting artifacts relevant to the Conditional Final Wall result.

Documents the single conditional dependency on which the entire program rests.

Provides a reproducible map of dependencies, formalizations, and empirical search efforts.

Serves as a stable reference for reviewers and archivists.

This repository provides the formal backbone for the conditional dependency.

Empirical Counterexample Search

Tooling and structured search strategies for potential counterexamples to overlap rigidity, including:

WL1, WL2, WL3 refinement methods

Radius-sensitive refinements

Local type enumeration

Permutation lifts

No counterexample families were identified in bounded-degree stress testing.

Program Status

Status: Conditional Completion

All major reductions, formalizations, and empirical investigations in the locality–cycle overlap program have been completed. A single dependency remains:

Overlap Rigidity Axiom:

Bounded-degree graphs with sufficiently rich local cycle overlap cannot remain FO^k-homogeneous at all bounded radii.

The program is therefore conditionally complete pending resolution of this axiom.

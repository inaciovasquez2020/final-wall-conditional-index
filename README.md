# final-wall-conditional-index

Index of all **conditional dependencies** in the Final Wall program.

This repository contains the authoritative listing of all conditional statements, assumptions, and prerequisite lemmas/structures that are referenced in the Formal Final Wall argument but are not yet proven unconditionally. It serves as a **dependency index** to support reproducibility, tracking, and structured closure planning.

## Purpose

The Final Wall program involves a complex set of structural components (definitions, lemmas, conditional propositions) whose formal relationships and dependencies are crucial for coherent advancement. This repository centralizes **all conditional dependencies** — i.e., all assumptions or statements that the program currently treats as *conditioned on* (not yet proven or resolved without additional witness or inequality).

This index is intended to:

- document each conditional dependency clearly,
- disclose the exact context and source where it arises,
- serve as a tracking surface for closure efforts in the program,
- support reproducibility and audit of the logical scaffolding.

It does **not** contain proofs of these dependencies.
